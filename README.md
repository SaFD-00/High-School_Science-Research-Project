# High-School_Science-Research-Project

Science Reasearch History of Myeongduk High School from 2016 to 2018.

1. (2016) Comparison of Food Handling Capacity in the American East according to the Acidity and Sugar Content of Food
2. (2017) A Study on the Comparison of the Appearance and Ecological Humidity of Korea's Unique Rare Species 'Hairworm Deerbug' and 'Hairworm Deerbug'
3. (2017) A Study on the Improvement of Heating Efficiency of Ceiling Heating System by Expansion of Humidification System

First and second were researched at life science circles 'Hermes'.<br>Those were won the first prize at in-school R&E competition.
<br><br>
Third was researched at contest of 'STEAM R&E' with friends.<br><br>
